## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

Lab 1
* Lab 1, Part 1

  * The reason why Lab 1 Part 1 is one of my favorite labs is that it was the first thing most of us learned how to code, which helped us throughout the semester by teaching us how to use git clone, which we used throughout the year. One major change I remember my partner and I making was turning it in because we didnâ€™t know how to use the git clone command ðŸ˜‚.

Lab 7
* Lab 7, Part 2

  * Lab 7 Part 2 was complicated, but it was doable. Now you might be wondering why I consider it one of my favorite labs, and the reason is because it was like learning how to park a car again. The reason I saw it like that is because learning how to drive and park a car takes time, just as learning how to type this code took time to get it right. When it comes to what I learned in that lab, it showed me how useful functionality is.

Lab 10
* Lab 10, Part 2

  * The final lab that I enjoyed was Lab 10, Part 2. The main reason is that it was one of the first times that I used 2D vectors, and it showed me how useful they are. Another reason why I enjoyed it was mainly because it showed me new places in California that I would never have thought of looking at or wanting to visit.
